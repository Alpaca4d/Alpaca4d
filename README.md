## To Do List

### Domenico Gaudioso

* [x] hdf5 - Numerical Nodal Displacements. Points, Displacement, Rotation
* [x] hdf5 - Numerical Reaction forces. Points, Forces, Moments
* [x] hdf5 - Nx, Vy, Vz, Mx, My, Mz
* [x] hdf5 - Numerical Stress Shells. Values are in the Gauss Points
* [ ] hdf5 - Numerical Stress Bricks. Values are in the Gauss Points
* [x] Disassemble Model - Line, Mesh, Brick, Load, Support, Section
* [ ] Visualize Model - one single component for visualise with the boolean
* [ ] Update the components to visualize the Supports, Loads, Beams. (we need to find a clever function to do an autoscale for the support dimension)
* [ ] Components for Cross Section (Circle, Rectangular, Box). I assume they will have the type (elastic section where we calculate the value Area, Iy, Iz, ect, ect)


* [ ] Update Deformed Dynamic Model
* [x] time-history: Displacement Vector every TimeStep for each node. Example: {0}(200)   {timeStep}(numbers of nodE)
* [x] Circular CrossSection has some visualisation problem / it update with Internal Thickness and not Diameter
* [ ] add "IPE" section

* [ ] check input english name for IPE. web = anima, flange = flangia. Karamba could be a quick reference to look at.
* [ ] add inetia zz in ipe section
* [ ] add box section

* [ ] circular Cross-Section less dense for visualisation
* [ ] add view distribuited load in model view
* [ ] add view concentrated mass load in model view ( create a sphere in node )
* [ ] Add Warning to the components. Ask Marco for some reference script
* [ ] Create Cluster when necessary
* [ ] password - Salvatore439505Merda506682!
* [ ] WIP Components BrickComponents
* [ ] add coding (in panel or path script ) and view post processing. Let's make a new component for import and visualize a text file
* [ ] modify loft mesh for brick ( problem con tetra )

### Marco Pellegrino

* [ ] Modal Analyses
* [ ] EarthQuake Analyses
* [ ] 
* [ ] 
* [ ] 
* [ ] Icons
* [ ] Be sure that works for computer with Space in the same c:/Marco Pellegrino/todo/todo

### Next Step

* [ ] Create Static Model with Color
* [ ] Create Modal Model with Color
* [ ] Create GroundMotion Model with Color

* [ ] Create Beam Displacement Visualisation
* [ ] Create Shell Displacement/Stress Visualisation
* [ ] Create Brick Displacement/Stress Visualisation

* [ ] Documentation - example (pdf)
* [ ] Create SocialMedia _ Facebook-Instagram
* [ ] Mail

### Further Step

* [ ] Image for Food4Rhino: Building, Kangaroo Shell, Beam Shell, EeathQuake City, Brick Elements. Background different for each image
* [ ] Analyse Burning Man, SteamPunk
* [ ] Automate the post for Instagram or Facebook: Which Hashtag should we use? Google Chrome allow to upload picture to instagram
* [ ] Create structure with PupperFish plug-in
* [ ] Contact UCL, Barlett, AA
* [ ] Contact: Arturo Tedeschi, Arthur Mamou-Mani
